===========

Repository for Android Phone users. If you have a Android (Droid x2) this is perfect for you. I am currently using the phone name previously. My aim is to list most working app's for android versions 2.0 or higher. I know how fustrating it is hunting down decent apps and games for your android phone and turn around and them not working on it. So lets avoid the hassle and suffering let me go through the agony of hunting through the web and app stores to supply you with the appopriate apps and games for your android phone!
